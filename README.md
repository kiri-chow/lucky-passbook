# Lucky Passbook

A book recommender system.


## Usage

You can run this demo project, by following the steps below.

### Install

First, you need to install [pypoetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependencies management.
And run the following commands at the project's root dir for installation.

```
# if you don't need poetry to manage your venv
poetry config virtualenvs.create false

# install the project
poetry install
```

### Import Data
For testing, you can download the
[instance.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pGdfsKB98GEqCJV5aWuHBQlO2X27nThf/view?usp=drive_link)
then unzip and place the `instance` folder to the project's root dir.

### Run Server
Once you installed the project, you can run the command 
`flask --app recom_system.server run` for a dev server.

The server will compute and update the users profiles at every start.
It may be a 2 or 3 minutes wait.

### Access Webpage
After the server loaded, you can access http://localhost:5000 for the demo page.

![login page](docs/login.png)
You can login with our demo user `anthony` for fully recommendation,
or input another name for a new user.

![cold start](docs/cold.png)
If you a new user, the system will ask for your preference of books for the initial user profile.

![main page](docs/main.png)
We have 2 recommendation lists based on collaborative filtering:
* **Our best guess**, generated by a cascade hybrid algorithm.
The books will be filtered by SVD++ and ranked by SVD-NCF (NCF using SVD matrix as inputs).
This list will only show for users who rated at least 5 books
(You need to restart the server if you are a new user who just rated 5 books.
Because we haven't implemented a worker to update users profiles automatically).
* **Similar reader choices**, this KNN via Content algorithm is available for every user.

![new main](docs/new_main.png)
And 2 lists based on the books' content:
* **Similar with your last choice**, it just simply returns the similar books of the user's last positive rate (>3).
* **Based on your description**, only for new user who haven't rated any book, based on the initial profile.


![not interested](docs/not_interested.png)
If you are not interested in some books, you can click the "Not Interested" button
and refresh the recommendation list. It won't be shown anymore.

![profile](docs/profile.png)
You can check the books you rated on the profile page.
